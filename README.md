Generate a heatmap from GPX data.

Drag and drop one or more GPX files into the window. No data is ever uploaded,
everything is done client side.

Loosely inspired by [The Passage Ride](http://thepassageride.com), which you
should join if you ever find yourself in Los Angeles on any given Wednesday
night.
